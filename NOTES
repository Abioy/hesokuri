Let's use hostnames rather than MAC addresses. Hostnames can be configured by
the user so are more flexible. Try to avoid reinventing the wheel in regards to
discoverability of clients, etc.

Clojure seems like a good platform/language - it is a powerful language and has
all the library support that Java has. Supporting things like notifications and
running as a service will have to happen with non-JVM libraries and tools, but
the core can be JVM-based. Python is more popular than Clojure, but basically
has the same limitations when it comes to platform-specific richness, and is
less powerful language-wise.

Keep a database of what peers have each version of local branches. When one goes
out of date, immediately push changes, even if the client seems to not be
responding. If the peer is not responding and they have out of date branches,
try a ping every few minutes. If a peer is not responding but we know it has our
latest branches, do not bother it.

Listen for file changes in the git repo to know when a peer has pushed changes
to me. Then, if the branch is "inactive" locally, try to merge it in
automatically. If the merge results in conflicts, abort the merge and leave the
remote branch. If the merge is successful, delete the peer-generated branch.

A branch is inactive if it is not checked out (includes all branches in bare
repos) OR it is checked out and there are no local changes.
