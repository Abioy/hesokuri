#Hesokuri

Distributed Git repo synchronization tool.

##Intro
Hesokuri synchronizes one or more Git source code repositories between multiple
machines on a network. It is useful in the following situations:

1. You want the peace of mind of controlling the machines where your source code
   is stored.
2. You control/own multiple machines and work on the same project on them.
3. You want changes on one machine to appear on all other machines as soon as
   they are connected.
4. There is enough disk capacity on the machines such that each repository can
   fit on two or more peers.
5. The data to store is confidential or sensitive so it cannot be stored on a
   third-partyâ€™s machine or on a traditional cloud storage system.
6. You want to use existing hardware rather than buy a dedicated backup device.

###What Hesokuri does
Simply stated, as soon as you commit a change in a repository, Hesokuri attempts
to push the changes to every peer that holds an instance of the repository in
the configuration file.

Hesokuri pushes commits on local branches to a remote branch called
`X_hesokr_Y`, where `X` is the local name of the branch and `Y` is the identity
of the host pushing the change.

####Live-edit branches
Sometimes, you will manually merge changes from `X_hesokr_Y` into the local
branch `X` when you need to access them. However, if `X` is a _live-edit_
branch, and it is a fast-forward of the local `X` branch, and the local `X`
branch is either not checked out or it is checked out and the working area and
index are clean, `X` will automatically be reset to the commit pointed to by
`X_hesokr_Y`. _This means if `X` is checked out and there are no uncommitted
changes to it, your working tree will update automatically when another peer
commits changes to it._ This process is referred to as _advancing_ in the source
code.

You can specify which branches are live-edit in the configuration file (see the
**Configure** section below).

####Sharing changes from other peers
For every branch named `X_hesokr_Y`, Hesokuri will try to push it to other peers
(besides `Y`) using the same branch name. This is useful for sharing changes
between two peers that are not running at the same time, but are running at the
same time as some third peer. In this case, the third peer acts as a carrier for
changes that did not originate from it.

##Getting started

###Requirements
All machines should have the following. Use earlier versions of each component
at your own risk.

1. Hesokuri source
2. [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) 2.1.3 or higher
3. Java Development Kit 1.7 or higher
4. git version 1.7.10.1 or higher
5. A Unix-like OS is recommended. Hesokuri is tested on Mac OS X and Linux, but
   Windows is worth a try if you are feeling adventurous.
6. A static hostname or IP address. i.e. you should be able to do `ping FOO`
   from any machine and get a response, where `FOO` always refers to the same
   machine. This is string is called the _identity_.
7. Public-key ssh login enabled for each machine. Super-condensed directions
   which will work for most cases (`CENTRAL` is the identity of some arbitrary
   "central peer"):
   - Enable ssh login on each machine if it is not already
   - For each peer, run `ssh-keygen -t rsa` (enter an empty string when asked
     for a passphrase)
   - For each peer `FOO` (including `CENTRAL`), run:  
     `scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub CENTRAL:/tmp/id_rsa.pub.FOO`
   - After the previous command has been run on all peers, run the following on
     `CENTRAL` for each peer `FOO`:  
     `cat /tmp/id_rsa.pub.* > /tmp/heso_keys`
   - For each peer FOO (including CENTRAL), run  
     `scp CENTRAL:/tmp/heso_keys /tmp/heso_keys`  
     `cat /tmp/heso_keys >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

###Configure
On each peer, create a file at `~/.hesocfg` which specifies all Git repos and
peers to sync with. Each copy of the file can be the same. The file should
contain a Clojure expression that is a vector of maps. Each element in the
vector is a different Git repository to sync (called a _source_). The map is a
dictionary which contains various parameters that control how the source is
synchronized. It requires at least a `:host-to-path` entry, which must be set to
a map of peer identities to local paths on each peer for the source. A source
need not appear on every peer. Here is an example which demonstrates the syntax
and optional source parameters:

```Clojure
{:comment
 ["You can put any data here as notes to maintainers of this file."]

 :sources
 [{:host-to-path {"host-1" "/home/fbar/repo1"
                  "host-2" "/home/fbar/repo1"}}

  {:host-to-path {"host-1" "/home/fbar/repo2"
                  "host-3" "/home/fbar/repo2"}
   :unwanted-branches #{"baz" "42"}}

  {:host-to-path {"host-1" "/home/fbar/repo3"
                  "host-3" "/home/fbar/repo3"}
   :live-edit-branches {:only #{"master"}}}]}
```

The syntax is identical to Clojure literal syntax. The important constructs are:
* `{}` indicates a map, which contains keys and values in alternating order.
  Commas can be used in a map to separate key/value pairs, but they are
  optional.
* `:foo` indicates a keyword named `foo`, which is used for keys in maps
* `#{}` indicates a set
* `[]` indicates a vector

Note that the distinction between maps, sets, and vectors are important when
writing a configuration file. The top level data structure is a map with a
`:sources` key (required) and `:comment` key (optional). The value of `:sources`
must be a vector containing source definitions, each definition being a map.

The meaning of each entry in a source definition is as follows:
* `:host-to-path` is a map of peer identities to the local path of that repo on
  the peer. Generally, you will want to make each peer have the same or similar
  path for a given repo.
* `:unwanted-branches` indicates the names of branches that should be deleted on
  this host. In the example, `baz` is an unwanted branch, so any branch named
  `baz` or `baz_hesokr_*` will be deleted on the host with this configuration.
  Such branches are deleted with `git branch -D`, which means that unmerged
  changes will be lost. Be careful using this option!
* `:live-edit-branches` indicates which branches are considered live-edit, which
  by default is only `hesokuri`. Live-edit branches are branches that, when a
  peer pushes changes to a local repo for a source, those peer's changes are
  merged in automatically if it is a fast-forward. If you specify `{:only FOO}`
  for this parameter, only the branches in the set `FOO` will be live-edit. If
  you specify `{:except BAR}`, then every branch will be live-edit except for
  the ones in the set `BAR`. 

You can edit a configuration file while Hesokuri is running, and it will
automatically restart with the new configuration.

An annotated, real-world configuration file may look something like this:
```Clojure
{:comment
 ["My machines:"
  "192.168.0.2 - the Linux laptop"
  "192.168.0.3 - the Mac desktop"
  "192.168.0.4 - the home server"]

 :sources
 [{:comment "Whiz bang project"
   :host-to-path {"192.168.0.2" "/home/johndoe/whizbang"
                  "192.168.0.3" "/Users/johndoe/whizbang"
                  "192.168.0.4" "/home/johndoe/whizbang"}
   :unwanted-branches #{"abandoned-feature1"}
   :live-edit-branches {:only #{"master" "vnext"}}}

  {:comment "Code that may come in handy later"
   :host-to-path {"192.168.0.3" "/Users/johndoe/hacks/lisp-snippits"
                  "192.168.0.4" "/home/johndoe/hacks/lisp-snippits"}
   :live-edit-branches {:except #{"private"}}}

  {:host-to-path {"192.168.0.3" "/Users/johndoe/hacks/game-engine"
                  "192.168.0.4" "/home/johndoe/hacks/game-engine"}}]}
```

Note that you can save the configuration file in a location other than
`~/.hesocfg` and set the environment variable `HESOCFG` to its location. This
way, you can store the `HESOCFG` in a subdirectory and put it in a Git repo to
sync (along with other miscellaneous configuration files and utilities that are
shared between all systems).

If a repo or any containing directory does not exist on a peer and you start
Hesokuri on it, the containing directory and repo will be created automatically.
This means that, in the above example, if the `hacks` folder containing the two
repos does not exist on `192.168.0.4`, you can run Hesokuri anyway,
`192.168.0.4` will create the folders and initialize empty Git repos, and other
peers will push the two repos to it as soon as they establish a connection.

###Run
To run, switch to the directory containing the Hesokuri source and enter
`lein run` at the command line.

###Web interface
You can go to <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser on any peer to see the
status of all sources and last-pushed hashes for each branch and peer. The port
can be changed from the default of 8080 by setting the environment variable
`HESOPORT` to the desired port number.

##FAQ

###Where does the name of the project come from?
From the Japanese word meaning "secret cash hoard." It was chosen because this
tool enables a kind of "hoarding" of data on a personal machine. The name also
contrasts this practice with the alternative of storing your data on a third
party server, while the alternative to a hesokuri is storing your money in the
family bank account.

###Does Hesokuri support synchronizing bare repositories?
Hesokuri is mostly tested with non-bare repositories with their own working
trees. Bare repositories should also work, assuming they are initialized
manually with `git init --bare` in the directory specified by the configuration
file.

###What happens when some peer is unreachable?
Before pushing a branch to a remote peer, Hesokuri makes sure it is responsive
with [`InetAddress.isReachable`](http://goo.gl/VnJL7o) (essentially a ping). If
it is not responsive, Hesokuri will not push anything to that peer. Every three
minutes, Hesokuri attempts a ping and push for every peer that does not have the
most recent version of a branch. You can also use the web interface to force an
immediate push for peers that failed their last ping.
